This is the practice we made, it was about a boat travelling a river (it was a bin tree), and the river had cities that could exchange products and had their own inventory. Stressful but fun :-)


To generate the httml you must:
->Type ``Doxygen`` on your Linux terminal and install what it says
->Write the command: ``doxygen Doxyfile``
->And that's it!

To view the diagrams other functions must be installed, but it's not compulsary to have them.
