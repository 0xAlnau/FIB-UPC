# PRO2
This subject focuses on learning object-oriented programming (OOP) and understanding how pointers work through fundamental data structures such as lists, queues, stacks, and binary trees. Moreover, we have to develop a project where we use binary trees, classes, and data structures.


We had to use the alias p2++ to compile our C++ programs. To use the alias you must introduce in the alias section of the ~/.bashrc file the following line: 

``p2++="g++ -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wno-sign-compare -std=c++11 -fno-extended-identifiers"´´

You can acces de ~/.bashrc file by typing: 

``nano ~/.bashrc´´ in the linux terminal.
