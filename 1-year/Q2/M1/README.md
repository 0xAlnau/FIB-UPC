This subject has two clearly differentiated parts. First, we study graph theory, and then we finish with linear algebra.
-Graph theory: We learn about different types of graphs, Eulerian graphs, Hamiltonian graphs, cycles, paths, etc.
-Linear algebra: Matrixs, equations, transformations, basis changes, and diagonalizations are the core concepts.
