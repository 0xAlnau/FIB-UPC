The aim of this subject is to learn how a microcontroller works through both theory classes and laboratory sessions. In the classes, we study the components of microcontrollers, their ports, how timers and interrupts work, ADC and DAC converters, and finally, how microcontrollers communicate with each other. In the lab we use the app Proteus and also the PIC18F45K22 microcontroller.
