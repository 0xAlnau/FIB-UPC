# PE
A mathematical subject where we start with the basics of probability before fully diving into statistics.

As mentioned, we begin with probability, covering probability functions and the distribution of discrete and continuous variables such as Binomial, Poisson, Exponential, and Normal.

Then, we move on to statistics, where we use the programming language R and work extensively with the Normal distribution to learn about confidence intervals for μ (mean), σ (standard deviation), and proportions.

We finish with the analysis of R programs that create linear regression models, both with one variable and multiple variables.

An important aspect of the course is a group project, where we work with R and analyze large datasets to create confidence intervals, develop linear regression models, and familiarize ourselves with discrete and continuous variables.
