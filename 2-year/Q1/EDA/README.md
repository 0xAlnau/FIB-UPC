# EDA
We start with algorithm costs and notations such as O(n), O(n log n), and O(nÂ²) to learn the basics. Then, we move on to data structures like maps, sets, queues, and priority queues, exploring how they work with heaps and binary trees.

Graph theory also plays a significant role, where we learn to implement BFS algorithms like Dijkstra's, DFS algorithms, minimum spanning tree algorithms, and topological sorting algorithms.

Next, we study exhaustive algorithms using backtracking. Finally, we conclude with deterministic algorithms and explore NP, NP-hard, and NP-complete problems.

To compile the programs I recommend using the alias ``p2++`` previously seen at PRO2. It will tell you every possible error, and even though it's really strict, it's helpful and useful.
