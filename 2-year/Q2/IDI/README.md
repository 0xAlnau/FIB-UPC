# IDI
In this subject, we start with the design of interfaces and how to interact with them. 

At the beginning of the labs we start with Qt5, but then we enter totally in the OpenGL functions and how to view models. 

In theory classes we see how to make geometric tranformations; how the View Matrix and the Project Matrix work; what is clipping; the camera functions and the third person camera; Euler's angles and more.

In IDI it is used Qt5.x, where x is >= 9. To compile the programs you must use the command: ``qmake-qt5`` and then type: ``make``

To be able to use ``qmake-qt5`` you must put in the ~/.bashrc file the alias: ``alias qmake-qt5='/yourPCrouteToQt/Qt/5.x/gcc_64/bin/qmake'`` in the alias section.

You can acces the ~/.bashrc file by typing: ``nano ~/.bashrc``
